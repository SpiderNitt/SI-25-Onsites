# Collaborative Code Sharing Compiler Tool

## Objective

The goal is to build a real-time collaborative coding platform that allows users to write, edit, and compile code collaboratively in a VS Code-like environment. The platform supports live editing via WebSockets, workspace sharing, and secure access control for seamless teamwork and coding efficiency.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Real-Time Collaborative Editing

**Functionality:**  
Enable multiple users to collaboratively edit code in real time within shared workspaces.

**Requirements:**
- Real-time synchronization using WebSockets.
- Conflict-free collaborative editing (e.g., operational transformation or CRDTs).
- Workspace creation and shareable invite links.
- Presence indicators to show active collaborators.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

**Functionality:**  
Securely manage user accounts and define collaboration permissions.

**Requirements:**
- User authentication via OAuth (e.g., Google) or JWT.
- Role-based permissions: view-only or edit access.
- Secure session handling and logout functionality.

### 3. Code Compilation Engine

**Functionality:**  
Allow users to compile and run code snippets in real time.

**Requirements:**
- Integration of a code execution engine (e.g., Docker-based sandbox or third-party APIs).
- Support at least one language (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- Display compiler output and errors live in the workspace.
- Ensure code execution is secure and sandboxed.

### 4. Workspace & Profile Management

**Functionality:**  
Organize projects and customize user profiles for better experience and identity.

**Requirements:**
- Create, rename, and delete workspaces.
- User profile pages with editable display name, bio, and avatar.
- Display a list of owned and shared workspaces.

### 5. Editor Interface

**Functionality:**  
Provide an intuitive, code-friendly interface for users.

**Requirements:**
- VS Code-like UI/UX.
- Syntax highlighting for supported languages.
- File tab system and line numbering.
- Dark mode toggle.

### 6. Notification System

**Functionality:**  
Keep users informed about important activity and workspace events.

**Requirements:**
- Push or in-app notifications for:
  - Collaborator joins/leaves.
  - File changes.
  - Compilation results.
- Optional email notifications.

### 7. Advanced Features (Optional)

**Functionality:**  
Enhance the core platform for power users.

**Requirements:**
- Selective collaboration: Assign permissions per file/user.
- Multi-language support (e.g., C++, Java, Python).
- Terminal integration for command-line access.
- Version control integration (e.g., GitHub import/export).
