# Exploring the Tor Network

## Objective
This project aims to dive deep into the Tor network and experiment with various features and tools. The goal is to complete as many subtasks as possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Tor network's functionality and security measures.

## Subtasks

### 1. Analyze Tor Traffic with Wireshark
- **Install Wireshark** on your machine.
- **Capture and analyze the traffic** generated by the Tor Browser using Wireshark.
- **Observe the encrypted nature of the traffic** and how it differs from regular web traffic.

### 2. Use Tor with a Custom Configuration
- **Modify the Tor configuration file (torrc)** to customize the Tor network behavior.
- **Experiment with different configuration options**, such as setting up bridges or using a specific entry guard.
- **Observe how changes in configuration affect** the browsing experience and security.

### 3. Explore Tor's Security Features
- **Research and explain the security measures** implemented by the Tor network, such as encryption, anonymity, and the concept of perfect forward secrecy.
- **Discuss the importance of using HTTPS** in conjunction with Tor for secure communication.
- **Explore Tor's security best practices and recommendations**.

### 4. Implement a Basic Onion Routing Simulation
- **Create a simple simulation of the onion routing process** using a programming language like Python.
- **Design the simulation to show how data is passed** through multiple nodes and how layers are removed.
- **Implement functions to simulate the encryption and decryption** of messages at each node.

### 5. Experiment with Tor's Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Explore the Tor CLI and learn how to interact** with the Tor network using command-line tools.
- **Use the tor command to start, stop, and monitor** the Tor process.
- **Experiment with the torify command to route specific applications** through the Tor network.
