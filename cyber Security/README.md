# CTF Challenge

Welcome to the Onsite Capture The Flag (CTF) Event!

## Rules

- **Stay Ethical**: Only target what you're authorized to.
- **Use Passive Recon**: No aggressive scanning or denial-of-service attacks.
- **Document Your Process**: Take notes — every detail might matter later.
- **No Sharing Answers**: Collaboration is allowed, but flags must be earned by your team.
- **Respect Infrastructure**: This is a learning platform, not a battlefield.

## Tips

- Look carefully at provided clues, domains, and metadata.
- OSINT is your friend — Use public tools to your advantage.
- Be patient, methodical, and creative.
