# Create and Deploy ERC20/721 Tokens using OpenZeppelin

## Objective

The objective of this problem is to create custom ERC20 and ERC721 tokens using OpenZeppelinâ€™s secure and audited smart contract library. You will implement, test, and deploy these tokens on a local or testnet blockchain, ensuring proper functionality and standard compliance.

## Problem Statement

You are required to use the OpenZeppelin Contracts library to create and deploy both of the following:

- **ERC20 Token**: A fungible token with standard features like transfer, approval, and balance tracking.
- **ERC721 Token**: A non-fungible token (NFT) with unique identifiers and metadata support.

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Token Implementation**
   - Use OpenZeppelin Contracts to create ERC20 or ERC721 token contracts.
   - Customize token details: name, symbol, initial supply (for ERC20), and metadata URI (for ERC721).

2. **Deployment Script**
   - Write deployment scripts using your preferred framework (e.g., Hardhat, Foundry, or Truffle).
   - Ensure deploy scripts are configurable (e.g., via `.env` for private keys and RPC URLs).

3. **Token Interaction**
   - Allow token transfers, minting, and (for NFTs) metadata retrieval.
   - Validate behavior through test scripts or CLI interaction (e.g., using `cast`, `ethers.js`, etc.).

4. **(BONUS) Web Interface**
   - Build a basic frontend to interact with the deployed tokens (optional).
   - Display balances, allow transfers, and minting for both token types.

**Deliverables:**

- A working smart contract using OpenZeppelin.
- A deployment script with configurable parameters.
