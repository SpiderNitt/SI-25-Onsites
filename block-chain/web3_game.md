# Web3 Game Architecture Analysis and Innovation

## Objective

The goal of this problem statement is to critically analyze the architecture of existing Web3-based games, understand blockchainâ€™s role in gaming, and propose a new gameplay mechanic or system innovation that leverages blockchain capabilities. You will also build a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate your proposed improvement along with architectural refinements.

## Problem Statement

You are required to:

1. **Research and Analyze**  
   Study existing Web3 games (e.g., Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Illuvium, etc.) to understand their:
   - Game architecture (on-chain vs off-chain components)
   - Smart contract design
   - Use of NFTs and tokens
   - Player ownership model
   - Economy design and incentives

2. **Justify Blockchain Integration**  
   Provide a concise but detailed justification for using blockchain in gaming, highlighting:
   - **Ownership**: True asset ownership (e.g., NFTs)
   - **Decentralization**: Trustless player interactions and governance
   - **Economy**: In-game currencies and player-driven economies

3. **Propose Innovation**  
   Propose a new gameplay or system mechanic that cannot be easily implemented in Web2 games. This can include:
   - Play-to-earn model variation
   - DAO-based quest systems
   - Smart contract-based PvP
   - Dynamic NFT evolution based on gameplay
   - Soulbound reputation systems

4. **Build a Proof of Concept (PoC)**  
   Develop a minimal working prototype (frontend + smart contracts or backend service) that demonstrates your proposed mechanic in action.

5. **Improve the Architecture**  
   Design or re-design the game architecture to support scalability, modularity, and better security based on your innovation.

## Key Deliverables

- Report detailing analysis of existing Web3 games and justification for blockchain usage
- Description of your proposed gameplay/system innovation
- Architecture diagram showing new or improved design
- Proof of concept (PoC) implementation with demo
- (BONUS) Governance, tokenomics, or interoperability considerations
