# QuickTasks Dashboard Redesign

## Problem Overview

**QuickTasks**, a mobile task management app, is experiencing critical user experience issues that are directly impacting business metrics. The current dashboard interface has resulted in:

- **68% user drop-off** within the first week
- **2.1-star average rating** on app stores
- **45% increase in uninstall rates** over the past 3 months
- **Declining user engagement** and session duration

##  Objective

As the lead UI/UX designer, you must **analyze the current broken interface** and **redesign the dashboard** to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience that drives engagement and retention.

## urrent Interface Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified:

- Information overload with excessive metadata
- No clear visual hierarchy or content prioritization
- Confusing task status indicators

**Usability Concerns:**
- Text too small to read comfortably (8-10px)
- Inconsistent button labeling and iconography
- Multiple floating action buttons causing confusion
- Touch targets too small for mobile interaction

**Accessibility Violations:**
- Poor color contrast ratios
- No clear focus indicators
- Overwhelming cognitive load
- Text doesn't meet WCAG guidelines
