# NextGen SecureConnect - SSH Client

## Problem Statement:
In a bustling tech company, "TechPioneers Inc.," the IT department relies heavily on SSH clients to manage their numerous servers and network devices across various locations. They use PuTTY as their primary tool but have encountered several challenges and limitations with its current capabilities. These include a lack of advanced features, insufficient session management options, and limited customization.

The IT team has grown frustrated with these limitations and has identified the need for a more advanced SSH client that can streamline their workflow, improve security, and enhance user experience. The management team has decided to develop a custom SSH client, named NextGen SecureConnect, to address these needs and extend the functionality beyond what PuTTY offers.

## **Tasks**:

### Requirements:

#### Basic SSH connectivity
* Implement SSH protocol handling.
* Add support for basic authentication methods (password and key-based).

#### Session management
* Develop features for saving and managing SSH sessions.
* Implement a user interface for session configuration.

#### Terminal emulation
* Integrate or build a terminal emulator.
* Ensure compatibility with common terminal types.

#### File transfer (SCP/SFTP)
* Implement SCP and SFTP functionality.
* Develop a graphical interface for file management.

#### Logging and session recording
* Creates a log for seessions.

#### Advanced features like port forwarding
* Add support for port forwarding.
* Implement customizable terminal settings.


### Technologies:

* Programming Languages: C/C++, Python, Java, or Go.
* Libraries: For SSH protocol handling, you might use libraries like libssh2, paramiko (Python), or JSch (Java).
* UI Frameworks: Depending on the chosen language, you could use frameworks like Qt (C++), Tkinter (Python), or JavaFX (Java).
