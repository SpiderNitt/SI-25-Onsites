# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation with Load Balancing, Load Testing, and Infrastructure Provisioning

## Objective

Building upon the foundational Task 1, this task expands the DevOps workflow to include automation, performance validation, and infrastructure-as-code practices. The objective is to ensure the application is continuously delivered, reliably deployed, performance-tested, and monitored in a scalable and maintainable way.

---

## Scope of Work

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Tool Options:**  
- Jenkins  
- GitLab CI

**Pipeline Requirements:**
- **Automated Docker Image Builds**: Trigger image creation for each microservice on code changes.
- **Unit Testing**: Execute unit tests as part of the build process.
- **Staging Deployment**: Automatically deploy to a staging environment upon test success.

---

### 2. Load Testing Integration

**Tools:**  
- Apache JMeter  
- Locust

**Requirements:**
- Simulate real-world traffic with load testing scripts.
- Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Use performance metrics as gatekeepers to block production deployments if thresholds are not met.
- Automatically fail the pipeline on underperformance.

---

### 3. Infrastructure Automation with Ansible

**Use Ansible to provision and configure:**
- Jenkins runners
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Database containers

**Playbook Modules Should Cover:**
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Application deployment
- Docker, Nginx, and database configuration

---

### 4. Advanced CI/CD Features

**Automated Rollbacks:**
- Roll back to the last stable version on deployment or test failure.

**Monitoring Integration:**
- Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time observability.
- Track application health, container status, and system resource metrics.

**Alerting System:**
- Trigger alerts (Slack/email) when:
  - Load test failures occur
  - Resource thresholds are exceeded

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline for build, test, and deployment.
- Integrated load testing with threshold-based release gates.
- Infrastructure provisioning with Ansible (IaC).
- Monitoring and alerting for proactive system health management.
- Improved deployment confidence with reduced manual effort.

---

## Approach

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Use Jenkins or GitLab CI.
- Define pipeline stages:
  - Build Docker images
  - Run unit tests
  - Deploy to staging on test success

### Load Testing Integration
- Use JMeter or Locust to:
  - Simulate user behavior
  - Test response times, throughput, and scalability
- Block production if metrics fall short

### Infrastructure Automation (Ansible)
- Automate:
  - Docker environment setup
  - CI/CD runner deployment
  - Nginx reverse proxy configuration
  - Database provisioning and initialization

### Advanced Enhancements
- Implement rollback workflows
- Integrate Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- Set up alerting systems for test failures and high resource usage

## Documentation Requirements

Expand your `README.md` with the following sections:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- Description of pipeline stages
- Configuration steps
- Accessing logs and build results

### 2. Load Testing
- How to run and customize JMeter/Locust tests
- Performance thresholds and expected outcomes

### 3. Ansible Playbooks
- How to use playbooks to provision infrastructure and deploy applications
- Inventory and variable structure

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts
- Setup instructions for Prometheus and Grafana
- Steps to configure alerting via Slack/email

---

## Deliverables

- Complete CI/CD pipeline with Docker, testing, staging deployment
- Load testing integrated with production gating
- Modular Ansible playbooks for infrastructure provisioning
- Monitoring and alerting dashboards and configs
- Fully documented deployment and operational procedures
